## Transmission WEB UI

This is a quick and dirty (and incomplete) re-theme for Transmission's Web UI.

### Installation
*Note: Your installation may use a different folder structure. Make sure you are copying to the correct location before proceeding.

* Clone or download the zip of this repository.
* Navigate to `/usr/share/transmission`.
* Rename the `web` folder `web_orig`.
* Copy the `web` folder from this repo to `/usr/share/transmission`.

You may need to clear your browser cache to force it to load the new UI resources.

如果你是中文用户,将`web`目录下的`index-zh.html`覆盖到`index.html`文件
